                <h2 class="text" id="about-section">The Objective:</h2>
                <div class = "website-content-section" id = "overview-text">
                    <p> 
                        The Asmara Resturant is an establishment serving Eritrean cuisine, and owned by a close freind's of mine family. He let me know that him and his family were looking to 
                        engage with their customers more effectivly through thier online platform, but felt that thier <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmaramaine.com/"> current website</a> was outdated and that they were looking for a redesign. 
                        Because of this, a group of designers including myself decided to redesign the three different portions of the current website to give them options to pick thier favorite design. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text" id="about-section">My Role:</h2>
                <div class = "website-content-section" id = "overview-text">
                    <p> 
                        I took responsiblity of redesigning their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmaramaine.com/contact.html">current the contact page</a> in order to make it easier for the user to
                        engage with the page when it comes to content and accesibility and provide options for them to contact the resturant. To do this, I first identified usability issues, created 
                        a visual style guide, then encoded a redesigned webpage would look like, which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://zabekey.github.io/responsive-design/"> here</a>.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text" id="about-section">The Process and Results:</h2>
                <div class = "website-content-section" id = "overview-text">
                    <p> 
                        This redesign process was broken into two parts:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1: Identify usability when it came to efficiency, learnability, memorability, and conceptual model of the page
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2.1: Create a visual style guide and mockups of the redesigned page to address these usability issues
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2.2: Use html and css to code what this redesigned webpage would look like following this style guide
                     </p>

 
                     <h3 class="text" id="about-section"> Part 1: Identifying Usability Issues </h3>
                     <p> 
                         In order to understand how to create a valid color palette redesign for the this webpage, I had to first understand the current issues when it came
                         to the webpage's usability. A summary of some of the major issues I found are listed below.  
                     </p>
 
                     <ul class="results-list">
                         <li>The page does not contain screen reader capabilities making it inaccessible </li>
                         <li>The image on this page that has little in relation to the contact information of the restaurant, making the page slightly inefficent</li>
                         <li>Font text of the same information varied across the page </li>
                         <li>No alternative text or labels were integrated into the webpage </li>
                     </ul>
 
                     <h3 class="text" id="about-section"> Part 2.1: Creating a Visual Style Guide and Mockups </h3>
                     <p> After observing these issues I then created a visual style guide as well as mockups in figma, seen below in order to deisgn how these pages should look in order to 
                        address the issues above. 
                     </p>

                     <div class="website-content-section">  
                        <div class="image-row">   
                            <h4>Computer Screen:</h4>
                            <img src="./assets/responsive-redesign/Computer Screen (Figma).jpeg" width= "70%">
                        </div>
                        <div class="image-row">   
                            <h4>Tablet Screen:</h4>
                            <img src="./assets/responsive-redesign/Tablet Screen (Figma).jpeg" width= "70%">
                        </div>
                        <div class="image-row">   
                            <h4>Phone Screen:</h4>
                            <img src="./assets/responsive-redesign/Phone Screen (Figma).jpeg" width= "70%">
                        </div>
                     </div>

                    <h4>Addressing Issues:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            Added a photo of the owner which relevant to the resturant and contact page 
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Utilized a consistent font throughout the page
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Used headings throughout the page in order to create visual heiarchy
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Encoded keyboard naviagtion and speech reader capabilites (within website)
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Incldued a section where the user could input an message and send an request or communicate with the restaurant
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Responseiveness:</h4>
                    <p> In these mockups I adjusted the platforms for things to appear differently based on the different-sized screens and modes of access used by the user.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            Larger Screens -> Horizontal layout in order to minimize scroll and fill up the space of the screen with a clear region of seperation between static information and the messaging portion 
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Smaller Screens -> Vertical layout as well smaller text in order to fit things on smaller screens while still allowing the user to effectivly engage with the information
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                     <p>
                        My last step in this process was to create this page using HTML and CSS. Screen shots of the page on differnt devices using googles inspect element tool can be viewed below as well as through visiting the page itself 
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://zabekey.github.io/responsive-design/"> here</a>, so feel free to access through different devices!

                    Through engaging in this project of redesigning a web page, I was able to gain skills when it came to being able to understand the current 
                    flaws and issues when it comes to usablity of a webpage and create cohesive mockups and an actual webpage to address these issues.
                    Through this I was able to deepen my understanding of webpages and building a responsive website to increase user efficiency, learnability, and memorability.
                    Lastly, as this project was done for a freinds family, it deepened my understanding that meaningful design balances clarity, context, and compassion.
