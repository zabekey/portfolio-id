                <div class = "website-content-section" id = "overview-text">
                    <p> 
                       The Department of Computer Science (CIT) at Brown University is a building near and dear to all computer science majors here and an interface that 
                       student interact with nearly daily. I was made aware that the building was undergoing a renovation when it came to the colors within the building
                       in order to offer a potential solution to thier rennovation alongside other designers submissions 
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       As an avid CIT admirer as well as passionate designer I thought, thought I would take a shot a redesigning the colors within the CIT myself and 
                       creating color palette for the redesign to follow, which was the objective of this project.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text" id="about-section">My Role:</h2>
                <div class = "website-content-section" id = "overview-text">
                    <p> 
                       I served as interior designer for when it came to the colors used within the CIT for things like the walls, furniture, railings, and more. Specifically, I was 
                       charged with choosing colors that satisfy accessiblity, contrast, the enviroment's purpose, and color rlies to rennovate the building effectivly and
                       have colors that work for the forseeable future.

                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text" id="about-section">The Process and Results:</h2>
                <div class = "website-content-section" id = "overview-text">
                    <p> 
                       This design process was broken into two parts:
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       1: Explore and understand the current color palette of the CIT when it came to its 
                       pros and cons, functionality indication, and accessibilty. 
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       2: Create my own color palette for the interior to flilow 
                       as well as create sketches of what the interior of the building would look like using this color palette compared to its current state.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text" id="about-section"> Part 1: Exploring the CIT </h3>
                    <p> 
                        In order to understand how to create a valid color palette redesign for the CIT, I had to first understand the current issues within the
                        interior of the CIT. My observations are compilied in a list below.
                    </p>

                    <ul class="results-list">
                        <li>Dark and gloomy, plaing into the office/work feel of the interior of the building</li>
                        <li>Colors often incosistent throughout the builing</li>
                        <li>Very little synergy and complement between the colors</li>
                        <li>Lack of natural lighting to make the space warmer and brighter</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text" id="about-section"> Part 2.1: CIT Color Palette Redesign</h3>
                    <p> After exploring the CIT and analyzing the current state of the interior I came up with the color palette seen below in order to address the issues above.</p>
                    <img src="./assets/paint-the-cit/Color Pallete.png" class="project-image">
                    <h4 class="text">Notable improvements:</h4> 
                    <ul class="results-list">
                        <li>Neutral and consistent colors that warm up the space indicate the space is meant for productivity</li>
                        <li>colors contrast well with each other accessibilty purposes</li>
                        <li>Utilized colors that are not assocaited with any type of color blindness</li>
                        <li>Colors complement the current furniture colors (mainly brown and gray) within the CIT</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text" id="about-section"> Part 2.2: CIT Sketch Redesign</h3>
                    <p> Lastly I sketched the current layout of certian floors in the CIT and utilized this color palette in order to design the interior and "paint" the walls with an example seen below.</p>

                    <div class="image-row">
                        <h4 class="text">Current State:</h4> 

                        <img src="./assets/paint-the-cit/CIT Unpainted.png" class="project-image">

                        <h4 class="text">Redesigned State:</h4> 

                        <img src="./assets/paint-the-cit/CIT Painted.png" class="project-image">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text" id="about-section">Conclusion:</h2>
                <div class = "website-content-section" id = "overview-text">
                    <p> 
                       Although my design was not chosen for the rennovation of the CIT I was still able to take a lot away from going through the process
                       of this project. 

                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Firstly, I was able to understand hwo much of an impact that color plays within different aspects of design 
                       from accessibilty to the functionality of the space. I was also able to understand how to think critically about the pros and cons
                       of the current design of an inteface and reflect in order to suggest improvements. Lastly, I was abel to experince going through 
                       the back and forth process of chosing differnt colors and designs until I landed on one that I was content with an thought would 
                       serve the purpose the best.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Overall I was able to go through a redesign process in which I learned more about this process and the impact of colors on a interface.
