                    <p> 
                       Apriora is a startup looking to revolutionize the way recruiters screen and interview candidates. The goal of Apriora is to utilize AI to conduct behavioral and technical interviews to take the work off the shoulders of recruiters.
                       They do this by conductin interviews in a web app on a desktop, in which the user will join a video call, where the interviewer is an AI model. 
                       <br>
                       <br>
                        In this project, I worked with a group of three other people in which we aimed to iteratively design the Apriora interface based on this concept. 
                        By making sketches, creating wireframes, visiting critique sessions, and testing a Hi-Fi prototype with outside users, we will have successfully 
                        created our own design for Apriora that builds trust in AI while reducing recruiter workload and improving candidate experience.

                <h2 class="text" id="about-section">My Role:</h2>
                <div class = "website-content-section" id = "overview-text">
                    <p> 
                        I served as the UI/UX designer, shaping Apriora’s interface from scratch through a full iterative process—sketching, prototyping, 
                        and user testing. As a product designer in general with a passion for creations that blend community, I focused on translating a 
                        complex AI concept into a welcoming, usable tool for both recruiters and candidates.

                    <p> 
                       This redesign process was broken into four differnt parts of sketching, lo-fi wireframes, hi-fi mockups, and user testing. These are
                       broken down below!

                            <p class="text"> 
                                The first step in our process was to brainstorm individually how the design could look, and sketching those ideas out. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                These sketches were made with the intention of  reducing time and effort for recruiters, enhance objectivity and quality in candidate evaluations, and create a smooth and human like experience for candidates in mind.

                                After, being critiqued, we then created high scale designs for usability testing

                    This project underscored the value of iterative, human-centered design when it came to redesigning a platform. 
                    We discovered that in an AI-driven product, trust is built through clarity, tone, and subtle visual cues. 

                    In the end, the redesign achieved greater efficiency without sacrificing the product itself but increased the human touch assocaited with it. 
                    Through this, we demonstrated that intentional design can connect people with emerging technologies, uniting strategy, community, and innovation in a seamless experience.
